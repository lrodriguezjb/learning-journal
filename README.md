Hello My Name is Leandro Rodriguez my Github link is [Here](https://github.com/lrodriguezjb) and this Learning Journal is a way for me to document my journey in becoming a Software Developer! and to share it with the world.

## Growth Mindset

To me having a Growth Mindset is essential in learning anything and I truly believe that this is a powerful mindset I could not sing or play guitar a couple of years ago but without even thinkning if I was born for that or not I just decided to learn and sometimes it was hard but by not giving up eventually me and people around me started noticing how good I was getting and to me this the best example of Growth Mindset.

### For me 3 reminders of Growth Mindset are:

1 - Always remember that Rome was not built in one day.
2 - What Im trying to learn has been hard for thousands of experts.
3 - Knowledge by Knowledge I will learn
