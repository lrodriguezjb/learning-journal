## Growth Mindset

To me having a Growth Mindset is essential in learning anything and I truly believe that this is a powerful mindset I could not sing or play guitar a couple of years ago but without even thinkning if I was born for that or not I just decided to learn and sometimes it was hard but by not giving up eventually me and people around me started noticing how good I was getting and to me this the best example of Growth Mindset.

### My 3 reminders of Growth Mindset are:

* 1 - Always remember that Rome was not built in one day. :muscle: :classical_building:
* 2 - What Im trying to learn has been hard for thousands of experts. :sweat_smile:	
* 3 - Piece by Piece I will learn all the knowledge.  :nerd_face:

# Day 2

Today was interesting I got to set up my Computer with the essential editor and configuration needed in my Journey on becoming a Developer. I learned about terminal and learned a few basic navigation commans such as ls and cd I believe Terminal is very useful and gives us another option aside from GUI.

## Terminal Shorcuts

* I love how commands entered are stored and can be accessed by using the up and down keys while allowing me to edit as well!.
* Learned about the command PWD which stands for Print Working Directory I believe this is a very useful command because without a GUI it may be fairly easy to get lost and now know where youre at at any given point but by using this command you can quickly find out where exactly you are.

## Text Editors 
Text editors are really important and can be very useful but this is only if the right text editor is chosen for the right job, I learned that there are multiple classifications of text editors such as Microsoft Word which is an amazing text editor if youre trying to write an Article, Letter, Etc... I have learned that the same way students and multiple office people use Word and other word processors like this one, Developers also need the right type of text editor for their work and even then a lot of these coding text editors have different features for different projects!. Some text editors that are worth mentioning are Atom, VS Code, Notepad ++ and Sublime Text but my favorite is VS Code because of its elegant design and for its features such as installing plugins and making the workflow seamless.
