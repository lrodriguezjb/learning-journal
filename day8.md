# Day 8
## Loops
Today I learned about loops in Javascript and their uses as well as the three different types of loops which are For, While and Do While. Another interesting about Loops is that they will keep running a block of code over and over unless a condition is met but otherwise this would be called an Infinite loop.

## JS Loop example

for (var 1 = 0; i <10; i++) {
    document.write(i);
}
