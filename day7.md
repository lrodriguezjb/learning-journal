## Javascript Functions

Today I learned about Javascript functions and I really like how it makes life easier by allowing to use a block of code over and over without actually having to rewrite the entire thing. As days go by and I learn more and more Im getting very excited because things are starting to make sense and I believe learning as much as I can will set up up a road for success for whats to come which is Code 201.
